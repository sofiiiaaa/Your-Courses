## Introduction

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly web applications. Developed by Facebook, React is known for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering of complex UIs. Its primary use is for building Single Page Applications (SPAs), where users interact with the app without requiring page reloads.

As a React developer, you should know the following:

* JavaScript (ES6): Strong knowledge of JavaScript, particularly the ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) features, is essential for React development.
* Components: Understand how to create functional and class-based components, along with managing their state and lifecycle.
* Props: Know how to pass data between components using props.
* State management: Learn how to manage local state within components and global state using libraries like Redux or MobX.
* Hooks: Get familiar with Hooks, which are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components.
* Event handling: Know how to handle user events like clicks, input changes, and form submissions.
* Conditional rendering: Learn how to conditionally render components based on state or props.
* Higher-Order Components (HOCs): Understand how to use HOCs for code reusability and logic abstraction.
* React Router: Learn how to implement client-side routing using React Router.
* Performance optimization: Understand techniques to optimize performance, such as code splitting, lazy loading, and memoization.

Here's a lexicon of React-related terms:

* JSX: A syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript code, making it easier to create and manage UI components.
* Virtual DOM: A lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM, which React uses to calculate the most efficient way to update the UI.
* ReactDOM: A library that provides DOM-specific methods for rendering React components and managing the DOM.
* Context API: A built-in mechanism for sharing data between components without the need for prop drilling.
* Error boundaries: Components that catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree and display a fallback UI.
* Functional components: Stateless components defined as functions that receive props and return JSX.
* Class components: Stateful components defined as classes that extend React.Component and have a render() method.
* Lifecycle methods: Methods that are called during different phases of a component's lifecycle, such as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.
* Controlled components: Form elements whose values are controlled by the React state.
* Uncontrolled components: Form elements that manage their own state independently of React.

By learning these concepts and terms, you'll be well on your way to becoming a proficient React developer. Good luck!

## ReactDom and VirtualDom
### ReactDOM
ReactDOM is a library that provides DOM-specific methods to interact with the actual DOM (Document Object Model) in a web browser. ReactDOM is responsible for rendering React components to the DOM, updating the UI when state changes, and handling browser events. The most common method used in ReactDOM is ReactDOM.render(), which is used to mount your root React component to the DOM.

Example:

```jsx

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```
Childish explanation:

ReactDOM is like a painter who takes the picture you drew (your React app) and puts it on a canvas (the web page) for everyone to see. It's also responsible for changing the picture whenever you want to update it.

### Virtual DOM

The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM. React uses the Virtual DOM to track changes in the UI efficiently. When the state of a component changes, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree, compares it with the current one (a process called "reconciliation" or "diffing"), and then updates only the parts of the actual DOM that have changed. This process is known as "DOM diffing" and is much faster than updating the entire DOM.

Childish explanation:

The Virtual DOM is like a sketchbook for your LEGO world (app). Instead of rebuilding the entire world whenever something changes, you can draw a new picture of the world in your sketchbook, compare it with the old picture, and then only change the parts that are different in the actual world.

Differences between ReactDOM and Virtual DOM

* ReactDOM is a library that interacts with the actual DOM, while the Virtual DOM is a concept or a technique used by React to optimize UI updates.
* ReactDOM is responsible for rendering and updating React components in the actual DOM, whereas the Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the DOM used to calculate the most efficient way to update the UI.
* ReactDOM deals with browser-specific implementations, while the Virtual DOM abstracts away these details and allows React to work seamlessly across different platforms (like React Native).

### ReactDOM vs Virtual DOM

The role of ReactDOM in rendering and updating React components is crucial for ensuring that your React application gets displayed correctly in the browser and stays up-to-date as the application state changes. Here's a breakdown of its role:

1. Initial rendering:
  When you start your React application, ReactDOM is responsible for rendering the root React component and its children to the actual DOM. This process is called "mounting." You typically use the ReactDOM.render() method to achieve this, specifying the root component and the DOM element where the component should be mounted.
  Example: 
  ```jsx
  
  import React from 'react';
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
  import App from './App';
  
  ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
  ```
  In this example, ReactDOM takes the <App /> component and renders it inside the DOM element with the ID root.

2. Updating components:

  Whenever there's a change in the state or props of a component, ReactDOM is responsible for updating the actual DOM to reflect those changes. However, instead of updating the entire DOM, ReactDOM utilizes the Virtual DOM to optimize this process.
  
  When a component's state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree representing the updated UI. ReactDOM then compares this new Virtual DOM tree with the current one in a process called "reconciliation" or "diffing." After identifying the differences, ReactDOM updates only the parts of the actual DOM that have changed. This process is known as "DOM diffing" and helps to improve the performance of your application by reducing the time and resources needed for updates.

3. Handling browser events:

  ReactDOM is also responsible for attaching event listeners to the actual DOM and handling browser events. When you define event handlers in your React components, like onClick or onChange, ReactDOM ensures that these events are correctly bound to the actual DOM elements and executed when the events are triggered.

In summary, ReactDOM plays a vital role in rendering your React components to the browser, updating the DOM efficiently when the state or props change, and handling browser events. It works together with React and the Virtual DOM to provide a smooth and performant user experience in your web applications.


## How to Create-React-App
Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a new React app using the Create React App (CRA) library:

Install Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager) on your computer, if you haven't already. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website.

Open your terminal and run the following command to install the Create React App globally:

```sh
npm install -g create-react-app
```

This will install the Create React App globally on your computer, which means you can use it to create new React apps from anywhere on your machine.

Once the installation is complete, navigate to the directory where you want to create your new React app, using the cd command in your terminal.

Run the following command to create a new React app using Create React App:


```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
```
Replace "my-app" with the name you want to give to your new React app. This command will create a new directory called "my-app" (or whatever name you chose) in the current directory, and it will contain all the files and folders necessary to start building your new React app.

Once the installation process is complete, navigate to the newly created directory using the cd command:


```sh
cd my-app
```

Now you can start the development server and see your app in action by running the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open your app in a browser window at http://localhost:3000. You can now start building your new React app!

That's it! You have now successfully created a new React app using Create React App. You can use this as a starting point for building your own web application.
