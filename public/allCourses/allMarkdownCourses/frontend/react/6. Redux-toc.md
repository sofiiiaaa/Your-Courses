## React-Redux

React-Redux

React-Redux is a library that connects the Redux state management library with React applications. It allows you to manage the global state of your application and provides an efficient way to share state across components. React-Redux provides the Provider component to make the Redux store available to the entire app and the useSelector and useDispatch hooks to access and update the store from individual components.

Redux Toolkit is the official, opinionated, and batteries-included toolset for Redux, aiming to simplify common tasks, provide best practices, and reduce boilerplate code. It includes utility functions for creating actions, reducers, and configuring the store.

* Childish explanation:
React-Redux is like a big toy box (store) that all your LEGO pieces (components) can share. It helps them talk to each other and share their toys (state) without having to pass the toys around. Redux Toolkit is a special toolbox that makes it easier to organize and share the toys.
Best practices and Redux Toolkit example:

Here's an example of using React-Redux with Redux Toolkit:

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
````

Create a Redux slice using createSlice from Redux Toolkit:

```javascript

// features/counter/counterSlice.js
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    },
  },
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```
    Create and configure the Redux store:

```javascript

// app/store.js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import counterReducer from '../features/counter/counterSlice';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
  },
});

export default store;
```
    Use the Provider component to make the store available to the app:

```jsx
// index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './app/store';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
    Use useSelector and useDispatch hooks to access and update the state:

```jsx

// features/counter/Counter.js
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { increment, decrement } from './counterSlice';

function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>Decrement</button>
    </>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```
Best practices:

* Keep the global state minimal and only store data that is required by multiple components.
* Use Redux Toolkit to simplify your Redux code and follow best practices.
* Use createSlice to create reducers and actions, as it automatically generates action creators and action types.
* Organize your Redux code by feature, not by type (e.g., keep actions, reducers, and selectors related to a feature in the same folder).
* Use the useSelector hook
