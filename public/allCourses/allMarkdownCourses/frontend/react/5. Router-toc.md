## React Router
React Router is a third-party library that provides routing functionality for React applications. It allows you to define routes and map them to different components, so that different parts of your application can be rendered based on the URL. This helps you to build a single-page application that is more user-friendly and easier to navigate.

To use React Router in your application, you first need to install it. You can do this using npm or yarn:

```
npm install react-router-dom
```
Once installed, you can import the necessary components from the library and use them to define your routes. Here's an example of how to do this:

```javascript

import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import About from './About';
import Contact from './Contact';
import NotFound from './NotFound';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
        <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
        <Route component={NotFound} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```
In this example, we're importing the necessary components from React Router (BrowserRouter, Route, Switch) as well as some custom components (Home, About, Contact, and NotFound). We're then using these components to define our routes.

The BrowserRouter component is used to define the base URL for your application. The Switch component allows you to specify that only one route should match at a time, so that you don't end up rendering multiple components at once. The Route component is used to define each individual route.

In this example, we're defining four routes:

* The first route (exact path="/") maps to the Home component and will be displayed when the URL matches the base URL ("/").
* The second route (path="/about") maps to the About component and will be displayed when the URL matches "/about".
* The third route (path="/contact") maps to the Contact component and will be displayed when the URL matches "/contact".
* The fourth route (component={NotFound}) doesn't specify a path, which means it will match any URL that hasn't already been matched by the previous routes. It maps to the NotFound component and will be displayed when no other routes match.

### Parametrized path
In React Router, you can create routes that accept URL parameters, which allows for dynamic content to be displayed based on the parameter value. Here's an example of how to parameterize a URL using React Router:

First, we need to create a route with a parameterized URL path. We'll use the Route component from React Router to define the route. In this example, we'll create a route that accepts a product ID as a parameter:

```jsx

import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import ProductDetails from './ProductDetails';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Route path="/products/:id" component={ProductDetails} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
In this code, we're importing the Route component from react-router-dom. We're then creating a route that maps the URL path /products/:id to the ProductDetails component. The :id part of the URL is the parameter that we'll be passing in.

Now that we've defined our route, we can create the ProductDetails component to display the product information. We'll use the useParams hook from React Router to access the ID parameter:

```jsx

import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function ProductDetails() {
  const { id } = useParams();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Product Details</h1>
      <p>ID: {id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ProductDetails;
```
In this code, we're importing the useParams hook from react-router-dom. We're then using the useParams hook to access the id parameter from the URL. We're rendering the id parameter inside a paragraph element.

When a user visits the URL /products/123, for example, the ProductDetails component will be rendered with the id parameter set to 123.

We can also create links to these parameterized URLs using the Link component from React Router:

```jsx

import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function ProductList() {
  const products = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Product 1' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Product 2' },
    { id: 3, name: 'Product 3' },
  ];

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Product List</h1>
      <ul>
        {products.map((product) => (
          <li key={product.id}>
            <Link to={`/products/${product.id}`}>{product.name}</Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ProductList;
```
In this code, we're importing the Link component from react-router-dom. We're then mapping over an array of products and rendering a link to the ProductDetails component for each product. We're using template literals to create the URL path for each link based on the product ID.

When a user clicks on one of these links, they will be taken to the URL path that corresponds to that product's ID, and the ProductDetails component will be rendered with the appropriate product information.

Using parameterized URLs in React Router allows for more dynamic and flexible routing in your application. It enables you to create dynamic content based on user input and provides a way to create links to that content that can be easily shared and bookmarked.
