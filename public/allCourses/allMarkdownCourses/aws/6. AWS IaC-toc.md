## Deploy and managing infrastructure at scale: CloudFormation, Elastic Beanstalk, OpsWorks, and CloudDeploy
### CloudFormation (IaC)
It is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported). For
example within a CloudFormation template we can say: I want a security group, I want two EC2 instances using this
security group, I want an S3 bucket, and I want a load balancer in front of these EC2 instances.

then CloudFormation creates those for us, it will provision all the resources in the right order with the exact
configuration that we specify.

It is **infrastructure as code**. It is a very powerful tool to automate the deployment of your infrastructure.
The main benefits are:
- Automated provisioning
- Infrastructure as code
- Cost estimation
- Productivity

#### CloudFormation Template
It is a JSON/YAML file that describes your AWS infrastructure. It is declarative, we specify what we want and AWS
CloudFormation will take care of the rest.
example:
```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Description: "Simple CloudFormation template"
Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::Instance"
    Properties:
      AvailabilityZone: "us-east-1a"
      ImageId: "ami-0ff8a91507f77f867"
      InstanceType: "t2.micro"

  SecurityGroup:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup"
    Properties:
      GroupDescription: "Allow SSH and HTTP access"
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: "tcp"
          FromPort: "22"
          ToPort: "22"
          CidrIp: "
```

#### AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)
it define your cloud infrastructure using an imperative programming language. It is a software development framework
for defining cloud infrastructure in code and provisioning it through AWS CloudFormation. Instead of writing YAML or
JSON CloudFormation templates, we can define our infrastructure using TypeScript, Python, Java, C# or JavaScript and then
compile it into CloudFormation template.

#### Aws Beanstalk (PaaS)
When we deploy a web application tipically we use a ELB + ASG + EC2 + RDS. Elastic Beanstalk is a service that allows
us to deploy and scale web applications and services.

It is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS. It uses all the components we need to deploy and
scale our application (ELB, ASG, EC2, RDS, etc). We simply upload our application code and Elastic Beanstalk will
automatically handle the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health
monitoring.

It is free but we pay for the underlying instances.

there are three architecture models:
- Single instance deployment: good for dev
- LB + ASG: great for production or pre-production web applications
- ASG only: great for non-web apps in production (workers, etc)

it supports many platforms (includes docker python and so on.) and it also has a full monitored dashboard and
even a CLI and IDE integration for metrics and logs.

under the hood it uses CloudFormation.

### AWS CodeDeploy
It is a service that automates code deployments to any instance, it works with ec2 instances and on-premises servers (hybrid service)

### AWS CodeCommit
It is a managed source control service that hosts secure Git-based repositories. It is a private Git repository. It is a
fully managed service that scales automatically. It is integrated with CodePipeline and CodeDeploy.

### AWS CodeBuild
It allow to build and test code with continuous scaling. It is a fully managed build service that compiles source code,
runs tests and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. It is integrated with CodePipeline.

### AWS CodePipeline

It is a continuous delivery service that automates your release pipelines for fast and reliable application and
infrastructure updates. It is a CI/CD tool. It is a fully managed service that helps us automate our release pipelines
for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates. It is a continuous delivery service that automates your
release pipelines for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates. It is a fully managed service that
helps us automate our release pipelines for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates.

It is integrated with many other AWS services (CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CloudFormation, Elastic Beanstalk,
ECS, etc).

### AWS CodeArtifact

It is a fully managed software artifact repository service that makes it easy for organizations of any size to securely
store, publish and share packages used in their software development process.

Is a secure, scalable and cost-effective artifact management for software development.

### AWS CodeStar
It is a Unified UI to easily manage software development activities in one place. It is a web application that helps
you develop, build, deploy and manage your AWS applications. It is an integrated solution for software development
projects. It is integrated with many other AWS services (CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CloudFormation, Elastic
Beanstalk, ECS, etc).

### AWS Cloud9
It is a cloud-based IDE (integrated development environment) that lets you write, run and debug your code with just a
browser. It includes a code editor, debugger and terminal. It is a cloud-based IDE that lets you write, run and debug
your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger and terminal. It is integrated with many other AWS
services (CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CloudFormation, Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, etc).

### AWS Systems Manager (SSM)
it helps us manage our EC2 and on-premises systems at scale. It provides a unified user interface so we can view
operational data from multiple AWS services and allows us to automate operational tasks across our AWS resources.
It is a system manager, state of infrastructure management tool.

the SSM session manager allows us to connect to our EC2 instances through a browser-based shell or CLI. It is a
secure way of accessing our EC2 instances without needing to open SSH ports.

### AWS OpsWorks
It is a configuration management service that provides managed instances of Chef and Puppet. It allows us to automate
operational tasks like software configurations, package installations, OS updates, etc. It is a configuration

### AWS CloudFormation vs Elastic Beanstalk
- Elastic Beanstalk is the orchestration of your app
- CloudFormation is the orchestration of your infrastructure
- Elastic Beanstalk uses CloudFormation under the hood
- Elastic Beanstalk is PaaS, we don't have to worry about the underlying infrastructure
- CloudFormation is IaC, we have to write the code to define our infrastructure
- Elastic Beanstalk is great for developers who want to deploy their code with minimal fuss
- CloudFormation is great for DevOps engineers who want to have full control over their infrastructure
- Elastic Beanstalk is quicker to get started with but less customizable
- CloudFormation is slower to get started with but more customizable
- Elastic Beanstalk is free but you pay for the underlying instances
- CloudFormation is free but you pay for the underlying resources
