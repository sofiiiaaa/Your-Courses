## IAM  Identity and Access Managment
that is aglobal service that is used to handle users and permissions. we have a root account created by default that should no be used or shared. Than we create **users** that are people within your organization and can be grouped.

We can create **groups** within IAM that can only contains users (not othes groups). a users can belong to multiple groups.

We create group for permission and allowing operations. users of groups can be assign JSON documents called policies: **JSON policies**.

We create the **least rivilege principale**, we do not give more permissions that a user need.

### IAM Console
1. users -> add user (IAM user) -> add user to group -> admin -> add tags (optional to keep more information to the resource).
2. create group -> admin -> administratoraccess.

we can create also the alias for the root ID that will be used to login while using IAM user. We can notice a difference between a root and a IAM user looking at the top right panel

### IAM policies inheritance
image that we have a policy assigned to a group, each people assigned to that group will have that policies. We can create also inline policies assigned to a single user.


Each user can have 2 policies:
1. Inline policies (directly attached to the user)
2. Managed policies (created separately and can be attached to multiple users like group policies)

policy example:

```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "VisualEditor0",  // identifier
			"Effect": "Allow",  // allow or deny
			"Action": [ // list of actions
				"iam:CreateUser",
				"iam:DeleteUser",
				"iam:ListUsers",
				"iam:GetUser",
				"iam:UpdateUser"
			],
			"Pricipal": "*", // who get the benefit of the strategy
			"Resource": "*"  // resource
		}
	]
}
```

### IAM Password policy
we can set the password policy for the users. We can set the password length, the password type, the password expiration and the password reuse prevention. We can different options:
- Require at least one uppercase letter
- Require at least one lowercase letter
- what ever you want

You acn allow all IAM users to change their own password by selecting the checkbox. and you can also force the user to change the password at the first login and change the
password every N days.

### IAM MFA
Users have access to your account and poosibly change configurations. You need to protect your root account and IAM users. You can do that by enabling MFA (Multi Factor Authentication). It is a security system that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify the user's identity for a login or other transaction.
MFA is using a combination of a password and a second factor. The second factor can be a Virtual MFA device (like google authenticator) or a U2F security key (like yubikey).

### IAM Roles
Some aws service will need to perform actions on your behalf, to do so will assign IAM roles. That are permission provided to AWS services.
The roles are used to delegate access to AWS resources to third parties. It is used to give access to AWS services to other AWS services.

It is used to give access to AWS services to your on-premise users. It is used to give access to AWS services to AWS services.

An example of usage of IAM roles is to give access to an EC2 instance to S3. We can create a role and attach a policy to it. Than we can attach the role to the EC2 instance. The EC2 instance will have access to S3.
To create a role the grammar is the following:

```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "VisualEditor0",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "s3:*",
			"Resource": "*"
		}
	]
}
```

From the console we can go to roles and select the entity type. Some commons roles are:
- EC2 instance roles
- Lambda function roles
- Roles for CloudFormation

We create a policy, we create a rule name and we attach the policy to the role.

### IAM Roles vs Users
1. Roles are universal, you can use them in any region
2. Roles do not have any credentials (password or access key)
3. Roles are temporary (can be set to expire)
4. Roles can be assumed by users, services or even AWS services
5. IAM roles are free
6. You can attach policies to roles to control what the role can and cannot do

### AWS cli configure
First we need to create and Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key. We can do that by going to the IAM console and than to the users section.
From the console go to IAM, than to users, than to add user. We can choose the username and the access type. We can choose programmatic access and than we can attach a policy to the user. We can choose the policy that we have created before (EC2FullAccess).

we can configure the AWS cli by using the following command:

```bash
aws configure
```

than we can insert the access key and the secret access key. We can also set the default region and the default output format.


### AWS cloudshell
It is a shell that is available from the AWS console already with the credentials configured. It is a browser based shell that is pre-authenticated with your console credentials.
It is a linux shell with 1GB of persistent storage. It is free to use, you pay for the underlying resources.

### IAM security tools
- IAM credentials report (account-level): a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials.
- IAM access advisor (user-level): show service permission granted to a user and were last accessed.

### IAM best practices
- Don't use the root account except for AWS account setup
- One physical user = one AWS user
- Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
- Create a strong password policy
- Use and enforce the use of MFA
- Create and use roles for giving permissions to AWS services
- Use access keys for programmatic access (CLI/SDK)
- Audit permissions of your account with the IAM credentials report
- Never share IAM users and access keys

#### Shared responsibility model for IAM
AWS is responsible for:
- The IAM service itself
- Managing the physical security of the underlying infrastructure.
- Compliance validation

You are responsible for:
- Users, groups, roles, policies
- enabling MFA to the users
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Monitor activity in your account review logs and use IAM credentials report.


### AWS Budget Setup

You need a root account to setup budget. For change it from the console go to My Account -> Edit Billing Preferences.
Then from billing -> biils is possible to see the costs of each service and the total cost. You can also see the cost of
each tag.

IAM user and Role access to billing information to let your users to see the costs and the billing.

In the same panel you cal also check the Free tier usage.

### Aws Budget

You can create a budget for each service. You can create a budget for each service and you can also create a budget for
each tag.

This budget allow you to set a limit and to receive an email when the limit is reached.

You can also set a forecasted budget, so you can set a limit for the next month.
