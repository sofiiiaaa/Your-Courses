# ONNX 
## Introduction
ONNX stands for Open Neural Network Exchange, and it is an open-source format for representing machine learning models. It allows for the interoperability and exchange of trained models between different deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Caffe.

ONNX was created by Microsoft and Facebook in 2017 to address the need for a standardized format that could allow for the seamless transfer of trained models across different frameworks. This would enable data scientists and engineers to choose the best deep learning framework for their specific use case without worrying about compatibility issues or the need to retrain the model from scratch.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how ONNX works:

Training a model in a deep learning framework: The first step is to train a machine learning model in a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Caffe. Once the model is trained, it is saved as a file in the framework-specific format.

Converting the model to ONNX format: The next step is to convert the trained model from the framework-specific format to the ONNX format. This is done using a converter tool that is provided by the deep learning framework or can be downloaded from the ONNX website.

Interoperability between frameworks: Once the model is in the ONNX format, it can be used in any deep learning framework that supports ONNX. This means that the same model can be used in PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Caffe without the need for any modifications to the code.

Deployment: Finally, the ONNX model can be deployed on any platform that supports the ONNX format, such as mobile devices or edge devices. This makes it easier to deploy models in production and integrate them into different applications.

Overall, ONNX makes it easier to work with machine learning models by providing a standardized format that allows for interoperability and exchange between different deep learning frameworks. This reduces the need for developers and data scientists to retrain models or rewrite code when working with different frameworks, which can save time and resources.

## Advantages
Some of the key advantages of ONNX:

Interoperability: ONNX allows for the seamless exchange of trained models between different deep learning frameworks, making it easier for developers and data scientists to work with multiple frameworks without having to rewrite code or retrain models from scratch. This can save time and resources and can also help to reduce the risk of errors that can occur when translating models between different formats.

Performance: ONNX models can be optimized for specific hardware platforms, which can improve performance and reduce inference time. For example, an ONNX model can be optimized for a specific type of GPU or CPU, which can result in faster inference times and lower latency.

Portability: ONNX models can be deployed on a wide range of platforms, including mobile devices, edge devices, and cloud platforms. This makes it easier to deploy models in production and integrate them into different applications.

Flexibility: ONNX allows for the use of multiple deep learning frameworks within the same application or pipeline, making it easier to choose the best framework for each task. For example, one framework may be better suited for training a particular type of model, while another framework may be better suited for deployment on a specific platform.

Community: ONNX is an open-source project that is supported by a large and active community of developers and data scientists. This community provides support and resources, including tutorials, documentation, and tools, to help users get started with ONNX and stay up-to-date with the latest developments.

Accessibility: ONNX is available for free and can be used by anyone, regardless of their level of expertise. This makes it accessible to a wide range of users, from beginners to experts, and can help to democratize the use of deep learning models.

### Visualization models
ONNX allows for the visualization of machine learning models using tools such as Netron. Netron is an open-source viewer for deep learning models that can display models in a variety of formats, including ONNX, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Here are some of the types of visualizations that can be done using Netron:

Graph Visualization: Netron allows users to visualize the structure of the neural network graph in the ONNX model. This can help users to understand the different layers and connections within the model and how they relate to each other.

Node Visualization: Users can click on individual nodes in the graph to see detailed information about that node, including its shape, dimensions, and data type.

Parameter Visualization: Netron allows users to view the values of the parameters in the model, including weights, biases, and other learnable parameters.

Output Visualization: Netron allows users to see the output of the model for a given input, which can help to understand how the model is making predictions.

Comparison Visualization: Netron allows users to compare different versions of a model side-by-side, which can be useful for debugging and optimization.

Export Visualization: Netron allows users to export the visualization of a model in various formats, including HTML, JSON, and SVG, which can be useful for sharing with others or embedding in web pages.

### Perfomance
ONNX can be beneficial for performance and production use cases. Here are some of the ways in which ONNX can improve performance:

Hardware Optimization: ONNX allows developers to optimize their models for specific hardware platforms, such as GPUs or CPUs, which can result in faster inference times and lower latency. This can be particularly important in production environments, where fast and efficient inference is critical.

Reduced Memory Footprint: ONNX can reduce the memory footprint of machine learning models by converting them to a more compact format. This can be important for deployment on resource-constrained devices, such as mobile phones or edge devices.

Reduced Computational Complexity: ONNX can simplify the computation graph of machine learning models, which can reduce computational complexity and improve performance.

Efficient Model Serving: ONNX can be used with various model-serving frameworks, such as TensorFlow Serving and Microsoft's Azure Machine Learning, which can make it easier to deploy and serve models in production environments.

In addition to these performance benefits, ONNX can also be useful for production use cases because it allows for the seamless exchange of trained models between different deep learning frameworks, making it easier to integrate models into existing workflows and applications.

Overall, the performance benefits of ONNX can make it a valuable tool for developers and data scientists working on machine learning models for production environments. By optimizing models for specific hardware platforms and reducing memory and computational complexity, ONNX can help to improve inference times, reduce latency, and improve overall model performance.

## HuggingFace integration

it is possible to transform Hugging Face transformers into ONNX format. Hugging Face is a popular open-source library for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification, language translation, and question answering. Hugging Face provides pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned on specific tasks, and these models can be converted to ONNX format for deployment on various platforms.

To convert a Hugging Face transformer model to ONNX format, you can use the ONNX exporter provided by the transformers library. Here are the basic steps:

Install the required dependencies: To export a Hugging Face transformer model to ONNX format, you will need to install the transformers library and the onnxruntime library. You can do this using pip:

```sh
pip install transformers
pip install onnxruntime
```
Load the pre-trained model: Use the transformers library to load the pre-trained model you want to convert to ONNX format.

Export the model to ONNX format: Use the ONNX exporter provided by transformers to export the model to ONNX format. Here is an example code snippet:


```py
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

# Load the pre-trained model
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Convert the model to ONNX format
inputs = tokenizer("Hello, world!", return_tensors="pt")
torch.onnx.export(model, inputs, "model.onnx")
```

This code snippet loads the pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face, converts a sample input sentence to PyTorch tensors using the tokenizer, and then uses the torch.onnx.export() function to export the model to ONNX format. The resulting ONNX model will be saved to a file named "model.onnx".

Once you have converted your Hugging Face transformer model to ONNX format, you can use it for inference on various platforms and devices, including CPUs, GPUs, and edge devices.

### Inference
To do inference on an ONNX model, you can use the ONNX Runtime, an open-source library for high-performance inference on machine learning models in ONNX format. Here are the basic steps to perform inference on an ONNX model using the ONNX Runtime:

1. Load the ONNX model: Use the onnxruntime.InferenceSession() function to load the ONNX model into memory:

```py
import onnxruntime

model_path = "model.onnx"
session = onnxruntime.InferenceSession(model_path)

```

2. Prepare the input data: Depending on the model, you may need to preprocess the input data before passing it to the model. You can use libraries like NumPy and Pandas to prepare the input data.

3. Prepare the input data: For text classification, the input data is a sequence of text tokens. You need to tokenize the input text using the same tokenizer used to pre-process the training data. You can use the transformers library from Hugging Face to load the tokenizer:

```py
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(tokenizer_name)
input_text = "This is a test sentence."
input_tokens = tokenizer.encode(input_text, add_special_tokens=True)

import numpy as np

input_data = np.array([input_tokens])
output = session.run(None, {"input_ids": input_data})


output_probabilities = output[0]
predicted_class = np.argmax(output_probabilities)


```

The session.run() function returns a list of output tensors. In this example, we pass None as the first argument to session.run() to get all the output tensors. If the model has multiple output tensors, you can pass a list of output tensor names as the first argument to session.run().

Postprocess the output: Depending on the model and task, you may need to postprocess the output tensor(s) to get the final result. You can use libraries like NumPy and Pandas to postprocess the output.

Get the result: The final result of the inference is the output of the postprocessing step.

These are the basic steps to perform inference on an ONNX model using the ONNX Runtime. The exact details of the input and output tensors, as well as the preprocessing and postprocessing steps, will depend on the specific model and task.

## ONNX Runtime infernce Server

Yes, there is a service similar to TorchServe for deploying ONNX models called ONNX Runtime Inference Server. It is a production-ready inference server that provides high-performance, cross-platform inferencing for ONNX models.

ONNX Runtime Inference Server supports a wide range of hardware configurations and deployment environments, including CPU, GPU, and FPGA, and it can be used in both cloud and edge scenarios.

The server provides a REST API and gRPC interface for making inference requests, and it supports features such as model versioning, load balancing, and health checks. It also includes tools for model conversion and optimization.

ONNX Runtime Inference Server is developed by Microsoft and is open source, like ONNX and ONNX Runtime.

If you are already using ONNX models and want a specialized service for deploying and serving them, ONNX Runtime Inference Server is worth considering.

### How to

! Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use ONNX Runtime Inference Server to deploy and serve ONNX models using Docker.

The easiest way to get started with ONNX Runtime Inference Server is to use the official Docker image provided by Microsoft. You can download the image from the Docker Hub by running the following command in your terminal:

bash

docker pull microsoft/onnxruntime-inference-server

This will download the latest version of the ONNX Runtime Inference Server image to your local Docker registry.
Step 3: Prepare Your ONNX Model

Before you can deploy your ONNX model with ONNX Runtime Inference Server, you need to make sure it is prepared for deployment. This includes converting the model to ONNX format if necessary and optimizing it for inference.

To convert your model to ONNX format, you can use a tool such as the onnx-converter command-line tool provided by the ONNX package. You can also use the export method provided by many deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, to directly export your model to ONNX format.

```py
import torch
import onnx
import onnxruntime as ort

# Load the PyTorch model
model = torch.load('model.pth')

# Create an example input tensor
input_tensor = torch.rand((1, 3, 224, 224))

# Export the PyTorch model to ONNX format
onnx_model = onnx.export(model, input_tensor, 'model.onnx')

```

Once your model is in ONNX format, you can optimize it for inference using the onnxruntime package provided by Microsoft. This package includes tools for optimizing ONNX models for different hardware configurations and deployment scenarios.
Step 4: Create a Configuration File

Before you can deploy your ONNX model with ONNX Runtime Inference Server, you need to create a configuration file that specifies the settings for your deployment. The configuration file is a JSON file that specifies the model and the settings for the inference server.

Here is an example configuration file:
```json
{
    "model_config_list": [
        {
            "name": "my_model",
            "base_path": "/path/to/my/model",
            "model_platform": "onnxruntime",
            "max_batch_size": 32
        }
    ]
}

```

This configuration file specifies that there is one model named "my_model" located in the directory "/path/to/my/model", which was exported using the ONNX Runtime platform and has a maximum batch size of 32.
Step 5: Start the ONNX Runtime Inference Server

Once you have prepared your model and created a configuration file, you can start the ONNX Runtime Inference Server using the Docker image you downloaded in Step 2.

tep 4: Build the Docker Image

The next step is to build a Docker image for your deployment. To do this, create a Dockerfile in a directory on your local system with the following contents:

```dockerfile

FROM microsoft/onnxruntime-server

# Copy the ONNX model file and the configuration file to the container
COPY models/huggingface_model.onnx /app/models/huggingface_model.onnx
COPY config.yaml /app/config.yaml

# Set the environment variable for the configuration file
ENV ONNX_SERVER_CONFIG /app/config.yaml
```

This Dockerfile specifies that we will use the official ONNX Runtime Inference Server Docker image as the base image, copy the ONNX model file and the configuration file to the container, and set the environment variable for the configuration file.

This command starts a new Docker container using the ONNX Runtime Inference Server image and maps port 8000 on the container to port 8000 on the host system. The command also mounts the directory containing your configuration file as a volume in the container, and starts the ONNX Runtime Inference Server using the configuration file as the model repository.
Step 6: Make Inference Requests

Once the server is running, you can make inference requests by sending HTTP requests to the server's REST API. The API supports a variety of endpoints for managing the server and making inference requests.

Step 6: Test the Inference Server

To test the ONNX Runtime Inference Server, you can use the onnxruntime package for Python.

First, install the onnxruntime package by running the following command:

pip install onnxruntime

Next, open a new Python script and add the following code to test the inference server:

```python

import json
import requests
import numpy as np
import onnxruntime as ort

# Define the input text
input_text = "This is a test sentence."

# Create the input tensor as a list of strings
input_tensor = [input_text]

# Define the URL of the inference server
url = "http://localhost:8000/v1/models/huggingface_model:predict"

# Define the request payload as a JSON object
payload = json.dumps({
    "inputs": {
        "input_ids": input_tensor
    }
})

# Send the POST request to the inference server
response = requests.post(url, data=payload)

# Parse the response JSON and extract the output tensor
output_tensor = np.array(json.loads(response.content)['outputs'][0])

# Print the output tensor
print(output_tensor)
```

This code defines a simple input text, creates the input tensor as a list of strings, sends a POST request to the inference server with the input tensor, parses the response JSON, and extracts the output tensor.

Make sure to update the input_tensor and url variables in this code to match your own input data and deployment settings.

The input tensor is defined by a dictionary with the following fields:

    name: the name of the input tensor in the model
    shape: the shape of the input tensor
    datatype: the data type of the input tensor
    data: the input tensor data in a flattened array format

The output of the inference request will be returned as a JSON payload in the response body.
Step 7: Scale Up Your Deployment

If you need to serve your model to a larger number of users or need to handle more inference requests, you can scale up your deployment by running multiple instances of the ONNX Runtime Inference Server.

To do this, you can use a container orchestration platform such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to manage your deployment. The ONNX Runtime Inference Server Docker image is designed to work seamlessly with these platforms and can be easily deployed to a cluster of servers.


### VS torchserve

Whether to use TorchServe or ONNX for deploying your models depends on your specific use case and requirements.

TorchServe is a framework specifically designed for deploying PyTorch models, and it provides a variety of features for model management, scaling, and monitoring. If you are working with PyTorch models, TorchServe may be a good option as it can simplify the deployment process and provide additional capabilities.

On the other hand, ONNX provides a standardized format for representing models that can be used across different platforms and languages. This can be advantageous if you need to deploy your models to multiple environments or integrate them with systems that use different frameworks.

In some cases, it may be possible to use both TorchServe and ONNX together. For example, you could convert a PyTorch model to ONNX format and then deploy it using TorchServe. This would allow you to take advantage of the features provided by TorchServe while still being able to use the ONNX format.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to use TorchServe or ONNX (or both) will depend on your specific requirements and constraints, as well as your familiarity with the different tools and frameworks.
