### Main concepts

There are many terms and concepts that are specific to Elasticsearch (ES), including:

1. Index: A collection of documents that have similar characteristics and are stored in Elasticsearch.
2. Document: A single unit of data that is stored in Elasticsearch. Each document belongs to an index and has a unique ID.
3. Shard: A subset of an index that contains a portion of the index's documents. An index can be split into multiple shards, which can be distributed across multiple nodes in a cluster.
4. Node: A single instance of Elasticsearch running on a machine. Nodes can be combined into a cluster to provide scalability and high availability.
5. Cluster: A collection of nodes that work together to store and manage data. A cluster provides scalability, fault tolerance, and distributed search capabilities.
6. Mapping: The definition of how a document should be indexed and searched. A mapping specifies the fields and their data types, along with any special indexing or search behavior.
7. Query: A request to Elasticsearch to find documents that match a specific set of criteria.
8. Aggregation: A way to group and analyze data in Elasticsearch. Aggregations can be used to calculate statistics, create histograms, and more.
9. Analyzer: A component of Elasticsearch that processes text to prepare it for indexing and searching. An analyzer breaks text into tokens and applies filters to modify or remove tokens.
10. Inverted index: The data structure used by Elasticsearch to store and retrieve text-based data. The inverted index is created by analyzing text and creating a mapping of terms to the documents that contain them.


## Architecture

Elasticsearch architecture is a distributed architecture that consists of multiple nodes working together to provide search and analytics capabilities. Here are the key components of Elasticsearch architecture:

* Node: A node is an instance of Elasticsearch that runs on a server or a computer. Each node can be configured to perform specific tasks such as data indexing, search, or coordination. Nodes can be divided into two categories: data nodes and master-eligible nodes.
* Cluster: A cluster is a group of nodes that work together to provide search and analytics capabilities. Each cluster has a unique name, and nodes within the same cluster communicate with each other to share data and perform searches.
* Index: An index is a collection of documents that share similar characteristics. Each document is stored as a JSON object and has a unique ID. You can create multiple indexes in Elasticsearch, and each index can have its own mapping and settings.
* Shard: An index is divided into multiple shards, which are smaller subsets of the index. Sharding allows Elasticsearch to distribute the load across multiple nodes and provides better performance and scalability.
* Replica: Each shard can have zero or more replicas, which are copies of the shard. Replicas provide fault tolerance and allow Elasticsearch to continue serving search requests even if some nodes fail.
* Gateway: The gateway is responsible for persisting the data on disk and restoring it when the node restarts. Elasticsearch supports several gateway implementations, including local, shared, and cloud-based gateways.
* Plugins: Elasticsearch provides a plugin architecture that allows you to extend its capabilities. There are several plugins available, such as the analysis plugin, which provides additional text analysis capabilities, and the discovery-ec2 plugin, which allows Elasticsearch nodes to discover each other on Amazon EC2.

Understanding the Elasticsearch architecture is essential to building scalable and high-performance search and analytics applications using Elasticsearch

### Index
In Elasticsearch, an index is a collection of documents that share similar characteristics. Each document is stored as a JSON object and has a unique ID. An index can be thought of as a database table in a relational database, where each document is a row and each field is a column.

An index is identified by a name, which should be descriptive of the data it contains. For example, an index named "products" could contain documents representing different products in an e-commerce store. You can create multiple indexes in Elasticsearch, and each index can have its own mapping and settings.

When you index a document, Elasticsearch stores it in the appropriate index and shard. Elasticsearch automatically manages the mapping of the fields in the document, so you don't need to create a schema beforehand. However, you can define the mapping if you want to customize the indexing behavior or control the format of the fields.

You can search for documents in an index using a query language called Query DSL (Domain Specific Language). Query DSL allows you to construct complex queries to retrieve documents based on specific criteria, such as matching text, range of values, or geographical location.

Indexes in Elasticsearch can be optimized for fast search and retrieval by tuning various settings, such as the number of shards and replicas, the mapping of fields, and the use of caching. You can also perform advanced analysis on the data in an index using aggregations, which allow you to group and summarize the data based on different criteria.

Overall, indexes in Elasticsearch are a fundamental concept that allows you to organize and search your data efficiently, providing the foundation for building search and analytics applications.

#### Mapping
To create a mapping in Elasticsearch, you can use the PUT mapping API to specify the mapping for a specific index and type. Here's an example of how to create a mapping for an index called "my_index" with a type called "my_type":

```shell
PUT /my_index/_mapping/my_type
{
  "properties": {
    "title": {
      "type": "text",
      "analyzer": "standard"
    },
    "description": {
      "type": "text",
      "analyzer": "english"
    },
    "price": {
      "type": "float"
    },
    "quantity": {
      "type": "integer"
    },
    "tags": {
      "type": "keyword"
    },
    "created_at": {
      "type": "date",
      "format": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
    }
  }
}

```

In this example, we are creating a mapping for a type called "my_type" in the "my_index" index. The mapping contains six fields, each with its own data type and analyzer:

The "title" field is of type "text" and uses the "standard" analyzer, which is the default analyzer in Elasticsearch.
The "description" field is of type "text" and uses the "english" analyzer, which is designed for English language text.
The "price" field is of type "float".
The "quantity" field is of type "integer".
The "tags" field is of type "keyword", which means it won't be analyzed and can be used for exact matching.
The "created_at" field is of type "date" and has a specific date format.

#### Data types
Elasticsearch has several built-in datatypes, including:

1. Text: Used for full-text search and can contain multiple words, phrases, and special characters.
2. Keyword: Used for exact matches and sorting. It's usually used for non-analyzed fields.
3. Date: Used for dates and timestamps.
4. Numeric: Used for numeric values, including integers, floats, and doubles.
5. Boolean: Used for true/false values.
6. Binary: Used for storing binary data, such as images and audio.
7. Range: Used for range queries on numeric or date fields.
8. Object: Used to store complex JSON objects.
9. Nested: Used to store arrays of objects.
10. Geo datatypes: Used to store and search for geographical data.

It's important to choose the appropriate data type for each field in your index to ensure efficient and accurate search results.

#### Best practices for index
Here are some best practices to consider when creating an index in Elasticsearch:

* Choose a meaningful name: Give your index a descriptive name that reflects the type of data it will contain. This will make it easier to manage and search your data.
* Define the mapping: Define a mapping for your index to ensure that the data is properly indexed and searchable. The mapping should specify the data types for each field, as well as any analyzers or other indexing settings.
* Use small shards: Use small shard sizes for your index, typically between 20-40 GB per shard. This will help ensure that queries and aggregations are efficient and responsive, while also allowing for better distribution of data across nodes.
* Use replicas: Use at least one replica shard to provide redundancy and ensure that your data is available even if a node fails.
* Use index templates: Use index templates to automate the process of creating new indexes with pre-defined settings and mappings.
* Manage the refresh interval: Manage the refresh interval for your index to balance the trade-off between indexing performance and search performance. A shorter refresh interval will allow new data to become searchable more quickly, but may impact indexing performance.
* Monitor and optimize your index: Regularly monitor your index and optimize it as needed to ensure optimal performance. This may include adjusting shard and replica settings, adding or removing nodes, or updating the mapping.


### Node vs Cluster
In Elasticsearch, a node is a single instance of the Elasticsearch software that runs on a server or a computer. A node can be configured to perform different tasks such as data indexing, searching, or coordination. There are two types of nodes in Elasticsearch: data nodes and master-eligible nodes.

Data nodes hold data and perform data-related operations, such as indexing, search, and retrieval. They are responsible for storing and processing data in the cluster. Data nodes communicate with other nodes in the cluster to share data and handle search requests.

Master-eligible nodes, on the other hand, are responsible for managing the cluster, including coordinating and overseeing the activities of the data nodes. They are responsible for tasks such as electing a new master node in case the current one fails, creating or deleting indexes, and maintaining the cluster state. A cluster can have multiple master-eligible nodes for fault tolerance and high availability.

A cluster is a group of nodes that work together to provide search and analytics capabilities. Each cluster has a unique name, and nodes within the same cluster communicate with each other to share data and perform searches. Clusters provide scalability, fault tolerance, and load balancing, making Elasticsearch suitable for handling large volumes of data and serving search queries with high availability and low latency.

In Elasticsearch, you can configure a cluster to have multiple nodes, and each node can be configured to perform specific tasks, depending on your use case. You can also add or remove nodes from the cluster dynamically, without interrupting the ongoing search requests or data indexing. This makes Elasticsearch a highly scalable and flexible system for handling data and serving search queries.

### Shard

In Elasticsearch, a shard is a smaller subset of an index that contains a portion of the index's data. An index can be divided into multiple shards, allowing Elasticsearch to distribute the load across multiple nodes in a cluster and providing better performance and scalability.

Each shard is a self-contained index, and it can be stored on any node in the cluster. Elasticsearch uses a hash function to determine which shard a document belongs to and where it should be stored. When you perform a search query on an index, Elasticsearch sends the query to all relevant shards, and each shard returns a set of matching documents.

Sharding has several benefits:

* Scalability: Sharding allows Elasticsearch to scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster. Each node can handle a portion of the index, allowing Elasticsearch to distribute the load and handle larger data sets.
* Resilience: By distributing the data across multiple shards and replicas, Elasticsearch can handle hardware failures, network issues, and other failures without losing data.
* Performance: Sharding improves query performance by allowing Elasticsearch to search a subset of the index in parallel. By breaking the index into smaller chunks, Elasticsearch can search each shard independently, reducing search times.

When creating an index, you can specify the number of shards to use. The default value is five, but you can adjust it based on the size of your data set and the performance requirements of your application. It's important to choose the right number of shards to balance the search and indexing performance with the overhead of managing the shards.

### Shard vs Replica
In Elasticsearch, a shard is a subset of a larger index. When you create an index in Elasticsearch, it is split into multiple shards, with each shard being stored on a separate node in the cluster. This allows Elasticsearch to distribute the data across the nodes and enables the system to handle large amounts of data.

A replica, on the other hand, is an exact copy of a shard. Replicas are used to provide fault tolerance and improve search performance. By having multiple copies of each shard, Elasticsearch can ensure that data is available even if one or more nodes in the cluster go down. Replicas can also improve search performance by distributing search load across multiple nodes.

The primary shard is the original shard that contains the data. Replicas are exact copies of the primary shard. When you perform a search, Elasticsearch will distribute the search request to all the shards in the index, including the primary and replica shards. Replica shards can be used to serve read requests, while the primary shard handles write requests.

In summary, a shard is a subset of an index, while a replica is an exact copy of a shard. Shards are used to distribute data across nodes, while replicas are used to provide fault tolerance and improve search performance.

### Inverted Index
In Elasticsearch, data is stored in an inverted index, which is a specialized data structure designed for efficient full-text search.

When you index a document in Elasticsearch, it is broken down into individual terms (words or phrases) and each term is associated with a list of document IDs. These lists of document IDs are stored in the inverted index.

When you index a document in Elasticsearch, it is broken down into individual terms (words or phrases) and each term is associated with a list of document IDs. These lists of document IDs are stored in the inverted index.

For example, suppose you index three documents:

```json
[{
  "title": "The quick brown fox",
  "description": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
},
{
  "title": "Lazy dogs",
  "description": "Lazy dogs don't jump"
},
{
  "title": "Dogs in space",
  "description": "Dogs in space are cool"
}]
```

The inverted index for these documents might look like this:

```md
brown: [1]
cool: [3]
dog: [1, 2]
dogs: [2, 3]
fox: [1]
in: [3]
jumps: [1]
lazy: [1, 2]
over: [1]
quick: [1]
space: [3]
the: [1, 2]
```

When you search for a term, such as "dogs", Elasticsearch can quickly find the list of document IDs associated with that term and return the matching documents.

When you search for a term in Elasticsearch, it looks up the term in the inverted index and returns a list of document IDs that match the term. It then retrieves the actual documents from disk and returns them as search results.

To ensure that search queries are fast and responsive, Elasticsearch uses a number of optimization techniques such as caching, filtering, and relevance scoring. Additionally, Elasticsearch supports distributed search across multiple nodes, which allows it to handle large volumes of data and high query loads.


### Operations
In Elasticsearch, you can perform a wide range of operations on documents. Here are some of the most common operations:

* Indexing: This is the process of adding a new document to an index. You can index a single document or multiple documents at once.
* Updating: You can update an existing document by sending a new version of the document to Elasticsearch. The update can replace or modify one or more fields in the document.
* Deleting: You can delete a document from an index by sending a delete request to Elasticsearch.
* Retrieving: You can retrieve a single document or multiple documents from an index based on a search query. The search query can be based on one or more fields in the document, and can include filtering and sorting.
* Aggregating: You can perform aggregations on documents to get summary information about the data in the index. Aggregations can be used to calculate counts, sums, averages, and other metrics.
* Analyzing: You can use Elasticsearch's built-in analyzers to analyze the text in your documents and extract useful information. For example, you can use analyzers to perform stemming, stopword removal, or tokenization.
* Highlighting: You can highlight search terms in the text of your documents to make it easier to see where the matches occur.

### Indexing strategies

There are several strategies that you can use for indexing documents in Elasticsearch, depending on your specific needs and use case. Here are a few of the most common indexing strategies:

* Bulk indexing: Bulk indexing is a way to index multiple documents at once, which can be much faster than indexing each document individually. To use bulk indexing, you send a single request to Elasticsearch that contains multiple documents.
* Partial updates: If you only need to update one or a few fields in a document, you can use partial updates to avoid reindexing the entire document. To do this, you send a partial update request that only includes the fields that you want to update.
* Parent-child indexing: If you have documents that are related to each other, you can use the parent-child relationship in Elasticsearch to index them together. For example, you might have a parent document that represents a blog post and child documents that represent comments on the post.
* Reindexing: If you need to make significant changes to your index (for example, if you need to change the mapping of a field), you can reindex your data into a new index. This involves creating a new index with the desired mapping, and then copying your data from the old index to the new index.
* Index aliases: Index aliases are a way to create a logical grouping of one or more indexes, which can make it easier to manage your data. For example, you might create an alias called "logs" that includes all of the indexes that store log data.
* Rollup indexing: Rollup indexing is a way to summarize and aggregate data from multiple indexes into a new index. This can be useful for generating reports or performing analysis on large volumes of data.

### Why is difficoult to update a document

In Elasticsearch, updating a document can be difficult for a few reasons:

* Lucene segment files: Elasticsearch is built on top of Lucene, which is an inverted index search library. In Lucene, the data is stored in segment files, which are immutable. When you update a document in Elasticsearch, the original document is marked as deleted and a new document is added to the index. The original document is not actually deleted until the segment file that contains the document is merged with other segment files.
* Indexing performance: Indexing a new document is generally faster than updating an existing document because Elasticsearch needs to perform additional work to mark the original document as deleted and add the new document to the index. This can result in a decrease in indexing performance when you have a high volume of updates.
* Versioning: Elasticsearch uses versioning to manage updates to documents. When you update a document, Elasticsearch increments the version number of the document. If you try to update a document with an old version number, the update will fail. This can make it difficult to manage updates if you have multiple processes or threads trying to update the same document at the same time.

To mitigate these challenges, Elasticsearch provides several options for managing updates, including partial updates (which only update specific fields in a document), optimistic concurrency control (which allows you to manage conflicts when multiple processes are updating the same document), and near-real-time search (which makes updated documents available for search queries within a few seconds). Additionally, Elasticsearch provides a range of performance tuning options to help optimize indexing and querying performance.

### Endpoints infos
Here are some common requests you can use to explore an Elasticsearch cluster:

The most commonly used endpoints in Elasticsearch will depend on the specific use case, but here are some of the most frequently used ones:

* Indexing documents: `POST /index_name/_doc`
* Searching documents: `GET /index_name/_search`
* Updating documents: `POST /index_name/_update/id`
* Deleting documents: `DELETE /index_name/_doc/id`
* Retrieving information about indices: `GET /_cat/indices`
* Retrieving information about nodes: `GET /_cat/nodes`
* Retrieving information about shards: `GET /_cat/shards`
* Retrieving cluster health information: `GET /_cluster/health`

#### Get document
* Get Index Information: GET /{index} returns the index mapping and settings.
* Get Document by ID: GET /{index}/{type}/{id} returns the specified document by ID.
* Search: GET /{index}/{type}/_search returns search results based on the query parameters.
* Field Stats: GET /{index}/_field_stats returns statistical information on fields in the index.
* Index Stats: GET /{index}/_stats returns various statistics about the index, such as the number of documents, size, and indexing rate.



### Lucene segment (advanced)
In Elasticsearch, a segment is a fundamental unit of storage that contains a subset of the indexed data. It is created by the underlying search engine library, Apache Lucene, which Elasticsearch is built on top of.

When documents are indexed into Elasticsearch, they are first written to a transaction log called the "write-ahead log" (WAL), which is stored on disk. After a certain threshold, the documents in the WAL are written to a new segment file. Each segment is a self-contained inverted index of the documents it contains, and each segment can be searched independently.

Over time, as more documents are added or updated, new segments are created and old segments may be merged or deleted. The segment files are also immutable, which means that they cannot be modified once they have been created. Instead, any updates or deletions to existing documents result in new segments being created that reflect the updated state of the index.

Segments play an important role in optimizing search performance in Elasticsearch, as they enable more efficient searching by reducing the amount of data that needs to be searched. By breaking up the index into smaller, more manageable pieces, Elasticsearch can parallelize search operations across multiple shards and nodes, and minimize the amount of disk I/O needed to retrieve search results.

### Monitoring elasticsearch

There are several ways to monitor an Elasticsearch cluster, including:

1. Elasticsearch Monitoring API: Elasticsearch provides a built-in Monitoring API that allows you to view detailed metrics about your cluster, including health status, node and shard statistics, and index performance. You can access this API using tools like cURL or a web browser.
2. Elasticsearch plugins: There are several plugins available for Elasticsearch that provide monitoring and management capabilities. These include the Elasticsearch Head plugin, which provides a web interface for monitoring and managing clusters, and the Marvel plugin, which provides detailed cluster monitoring and analysis.
3. Third-party monitoring tools: There are several third-party monitoring tools that can be used to monitor Elasticsearch clusters, such as **Grafana, Prometheus**, and Datadog. These tools provide more advanced monitoring capabilities and can be integrated with other monitoring systems.
4. Logging and alerting: Elasticsearch can be configured to log events and errors to various log files, which can be used for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes. Additionally, you can set up alerts to notify you when certain events occur, such as when the cluster reaches a certain threshold of CPU usage or when a node goes down.


## Query DSL

Queries are an important concept in Elasticsearch, as they are the primary means of searching for and retrieving documents from an index. Here are some key points to keep in mind about queries in Elasticsearch:

1. Types of queries: Elasticsearch provides a wide range of query types, including term queries, match queries, range queries, bool queries, and more. Each query type is optimized for different use cases and scenarios.
2. Query DSL: Elasticsearch queries are typically expressed in the Query DSL (Domain Specific Language), which is a JSON-based language for specifying queries and filters. The Query DSL allows you to specify the query type, along with any parameters and options that are specific to that query type.
3. Full-text search: Elasticsearch is optimized for full-text search, which means that you can search for documents based on the presence or absence of specific words or phrases within the text of the document. Elasticsearch uses a variety of techniques to match search terms, including stemming, fuzzy matching, and phrase matching.
4. Aggregations: In addition to searching for documents, Elasticsearch allows you to aggregate and summarize data based on various criteria. Aggregations can be used to calculate statistics, create histograms, group data by category, and more.
5. Performance considerations: Queries can be resource-intensive, especially for large indexes with complex queries. Elasticsearch provides a variety of techniques for optimizing query performance, such as caching, sharding, and routing.
6. Query expansion: Elasticsearch allows you to expand a user's query by adding synonyms or related terms to the original query. This can help to improve search accuracy and recall.
7. Query relevance: Elasticsearch assigns a relevance score to each document that matches a query, based on a combination of factors such as term frequency and inverse document frequency. You can customize relevance scoring using various options and techniques.

Overall, queries are a powerful and flexible tool for searching and retrieving documents in Elasticsearch. With a good understanding of the different query types, the Query DSL, and performance optimization techniques, you can create efficient and effective search experiences for your users.

### Text analyzer
In Elasticsearch, a text analyzer is a process that takes a block of text as input and produces a stream of tokens, which are the basic units of search in Elasticsearch. Text analyzers are used to preprocess text data before it is indexed in Elasticsearch, to ensure that queries can match the data properly.

A text analyzer consists of three main components:

1. Character filters: These are used to preprocess the text before it is tokenized. For example, you may use a character filter to remove HTML tags or to convert special characters to their ASCII equivalents.
2. Tokenizer: This is used to split the text into individual tokens. For example, you might use a tokenizer to split the text into individual words, or to split it into n-grams.
3. Token filters: These are used to modify the tokens produced by the tokenizer. For example, you might use a token filter to remove stop words (common words that don't contribute to the meaning of the text), or to apply stemming (reducing words to their root form).

Elasticsearch provides several built-in text analyzers that can be used out of the box, such as the Standard Analyzer, which splits text into individual words and applies lowercasing and stop word removal. However, Elasticsearch also allows you to define your own custom analyzers by specifying the character filters, tokenizer, and token filters that you want to use.

By using text analyzers, you can ensure that your text data is properly indexed and searchable, even when users submit queries with variations in spelling, case, or word order.

### Aggregations

Aggregations are a powerful feature of Elasticsearch that allow you to perform complex analysis and statistics on your data. Aggregations allow you to group and summarize your data in a variety of ways, such as calculating counts, sums, averages, minimum and maximum values, and more.

There are several types of aggregations available in Elasticsearch, including:

* Metrics Aggregations: These aggregations calculate metrics such as counts, sums, averages, minimum and maximum values, and more. Examples include the count, sum, avg, min, and max aggregations.
* Bucket Aggregations: These aggregations group documents into buckets based on certain criteria. Examples include the terms, date_histogram, and geohash_grid aggregations.
* Pipeline Aggregations: These aggregations allow you to perform additional calculations on the results of other aggregations. Examples include the derivative, cumulative_sum, and moving_avg aggregations.

Aggregations can be combined in a variety of ways to perform complex analysis on your data. For example, you can group documents by a certain field using a terms aggregation, and then calculate the average value of another field for each group using an avg aggregation. You can also nest aggregations inside other aggregations to perform even more complex analysis.

Aggregations are an important tool for data analysis in Elasticsearch, and can help you gain insights into your data that might not be apparent from simple searches or queries.


## Scaling up
There are several ways to scale up Elasticsearch to handle increasing data volumes and traffic. Here are some common approaches:

* Vertical scaling: This involves upgrading your Elasticsearch hardware, such as increasing the memory, CPU, or disk size of your nodes, to handle larger data volumes and queries.
* Horizontal scaling: This involves adding more Elasticsearch nodes to your cluster to distribute the indexing and querying workload across multiple nodes. This approach can improve search performance and handle larger query volumes.
* Sharding: Sharding is a way to distribute index data across multiple nodes in a cluster. Each shard is a subset of the total data set, and each node can hold multiple shards. This can improve search performance by allowing parallel processing of search requests.
* Index optimization: You can optimize your index settings and mappings to improve search performance. For example, you can use optimized mapping configurations, use field data cache, and limit the number of indexed fields.
* Query optimization: You can optimize your search queries to improve their performance. This can involve using caching, using filters instead of queries, and using a more efficient query syntax.
* Load balancing: You can use load balancing tools, such as HAProxy, to distribute incoming traffic across multiple Elasticsearch nodes. This can help distribute query traffic and improve search performance.
* Monitoring: You should monitor your Elasticsearch cluster performance to identify performance issues and optimize the cluster configuration. This can involve using Elasticsearch monitoring tools or third-party monitoring solutions.

Keep in mind that scaling Elasticsearch can involve tradeoffs between performance, cost, and complexity. It's important to carefully plan your scaling strategy and test your cluster configuration to ensure that it meets your application's requirements.

## Python integration

Elasticsearch can be easily integrated with Python through the Elasticsearch Python client, which provides a Python interface to Elasticsearch. You can use this client to perform various operations on Elasticsearch, such as creating and managing indices, indexing and querying documents, and performing aggregations.

To use the Elasticsearch Python client, you will first need to install it. You can do this using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command:

```python
pip install elasticsearch
```

Once you have installed the client, you can create an instance of the Elasticsearch class to connect to your Elasticsearch cluster. Here's an example of how to create a connection to a local Elasticsearch instance:

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

es = Elasticsearch(['localhost'])
```
Once you have created a connection, you can use the es object to perform various operations on Elasticsearch, such as creating an index, indexing documents, and querying data.

Here's an example of how to index a document in Elasticsearch using the Python client:

```python
doc = {
    'title': 'Example document',
    'content': 'This is an example document for Elasticsearch'
}

res = es.index(index='my_index', id=1, body=doc)
```
This code indexes a document with a title and content field into an index called my_index.

There are many other operations you can perform with the Elasticsearch Python client, such as searching, updating and deleting documents, and performing aggregations. The client provides a Pythonic API that makes it easy to work with Elasticsearch from within your Python code.

### Scroll API

The Scroll API in Elasticsearch allows for efficient retrieval of large amounts of data from an index. When performing a search query, Elasticsearch will return a set of search results, typically a fixed number of hits based on the search parameters. The Scroll API provides a way to continue retrieving results beyond this initial set, by providing a mechanism for clients to retrieve large numbers of hits in smaller, manageable batches.

Here's how it works: when a client makes a search request using the Scroll API, Elasticsearch returns a "scroll ID" along with the initial set of search results. The client can then use this ID to retrieve subsequent batches of results from Elasticsearch, until all of the matching documents have been retrieved. Each subsequent request to Elasticsearch with the scroll ID will return the next batch of results, without the client having to specify the original search parameters again.

The Scroll API can be useful when dealing with large datasets, especially when performing operations such as reindexing, exporting data, or updating large numbers of documents. It provides an efficient way to retrieve large amounts of data from Elasticsearch, without overloading the network or causing performance issues.
```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

# Create an Elasticsearch client
es = Elasticsearch()

# Define the search parameters
search_params = {
    "query": {
        "match_all": {}
    },
    "size": 100, # number of hits per batch
    "scroll": "2m" # time window to keep the scroll context open
}

# Initial search request to get the first batch of results and the scroll ID
res = es.search(index="my-index", body=search_params, scroll="2m")

# Process the first batch of results
for hit in res['hits']['hits']:
    # do something with the hit
    print(hit['_source'])

# Keep looping through subsequent batches of results until all results are retrieved
while len(res['hits']['hits']) > 0:
    # Get the next batch of results using the scroll ID
    res = es.scroll(scroll_id=res['_scroll_id'], scroll='2m')

    # Process the batch of results
    for hit in res['hits']['hits']:
        # do something with the hit
        print(hit['_source'])
```


## ES interview
